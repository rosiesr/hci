# demo-p5js
Demo of the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org)

This demo implements the classic [Snake game](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-snake-game.html) on the interactive system for [CPSC 484/584 Intro. to HCI](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s23/project).

Specifically, the game itself is implemented with p5.js and the data are obtained via a WebSocket.
Technical details for the interactive systems are available on the [course website](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s23/display_tutorial).
