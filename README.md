# HCI Project 
This code implements a mental wellness app on the interactive system for [CPSC 484/584 Intro. to HCI](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s23/project).

Specifically, the app itself is implemented with js, html, and css, and the data are obtained via a WebSocket.
Technical details for the interactive systems are available on the [course website](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s23/display_tutorial).


## Quickstart (Installation/How to Run)

TODO:

The default host is `cpsc484-01.yale.internal:8888`. This project uses purely html, css, and js and does not require any dependencies beyond that. To run the app, simply start the http simple server using python. 

## About the project

TODO: add brief description of project + what tasks the installation address

This project addresses mental wellness on campus. The purpose is to provide a destressing application through the following 2 tasks:

1. Users can select small accomplishments from the day using the display.
2. Users will perform superhero/power poses by following a sequence of poses displayed on the screen, which reduces stress. 


## Constraints

TODO: indicate explicitly if there are constraints from deployment env (phsyical constraints)
