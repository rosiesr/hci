# HCI Project 
This code implements a mental wellness app on the interactive system for [CPSC 484/584 Intro. to HCI](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s23/project).

Specifically, the app itself is implemented with js, html, and css, and the data are obtained via a WebSocket.
Technical details for the interactive systems are available on the [course website](https://cpsc484-584-hci.gitlab.io/s23/display_tutorial).
